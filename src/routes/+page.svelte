<p>
	My cognitive gears turn in their unique way, making the conventional educational path a mismatch
	for me. While I dabbled in a few college courses, my true knowledge reservoir comes from the
	realms of self-study and hands-on experimentationâ€”like the art of reverse engineering websites.
	Fueled by an insatiable passion for learning, I constantly seek fresh avenues to refine my skills
	and navigate the ever-evolving landscape. Join me as I recount encounters with some of the most
	influential educators who have illuminated my learning journey:
</p>

<div class="teachers">
	{#each teachers as teacher}
		<Teacher {teacher} />
	{/each}
</div>

<h3>Here are my most used skilled</h3>
<SkillGrid skills={topSkills} />
<Link href="/skills">See all my skills</Link>

<style>
	p {
		color: var(--primary);
		font-size: clamp(1.25rem, 1.75svw, 1.5rem) !important;
	}

	.teachers {
		display: grid;
		gap: var(--gap);
		padding-bottom: var(--padding-lg);
	}
</style>
