<p>
	My cognitive gears turn in their unique way, making the conventional educational path a mismatch
	for me. While I dabbled in a few college courses, my true knowledge reservoir comes from the
	realms of self-study and hands-on experimentationâ€”like the art of reverse engineering websites.
	Fueled by an insatiable passion for learning, I constantly seek fresh avenues to refine my skills
	and navigate the ever-evolving landscape. Join me as I recount encounters with some of the most
	influential educators who have illuminated my learning journey
