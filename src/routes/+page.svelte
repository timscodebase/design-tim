<Fancy>
	My cognitive gears turn in their unique way, making the conventional educational path a mismatch
	for me. While I dabbled in a few college courses, my true knowledge reservoir comes from the
	realms of self-study and hands-on experimentationâ€”like the art of reverse engineering websites.

	and navigate the ever-evolving landscape. The following are some of my favorite teachers:

<div class="teachers">
	{#each teachers as teacher}
		<Teacher {teacher} />
	{/each}

<h2>Here are my most used skilled</h2>
<SkillGrid skills={topSkills} />
<Link href="/skills">See all my skills</Link>

		gap: var(--gap);
		margin-bottom: var(--margin-lg);
		padding-bottom: var(--padding-lg);
		border-bottom: var(--primary) 4px solid;
	}
