When React was new on the scene, I knew it would be huge.  It had to compete with and Vue, but ultimately, when I do a search on any job board for "Frontend Developer" jobs, I see mostly React jobs.  This is not a problem pre se, but there are now so many other React alternatives that are arguably more performant and with a better developer experience to React.  I think now is the time to let React rest and let Svelte have it's time to shine.

Obviously, I prefer Svelte and SvelteKit and feel it is the best choice for any new project big or small and I implore stack holders and technical leads consider it going forward over React.  I am sure I am not speaking for every developer out there, in fact I know I may only be talking to a small group, however, I have the same feeling now about Svelte as I did for react when it was first gaining steam.

## Why Svelte over React

In the realm of performance, Svelte emerges as a frontrunner due to its impressive compactness. The .gzip version of Svelte weighs in at a mere 1.6 kilobytes, showcasing its efficiency. In stark contrast, React, coupled with ReactDOM and compressed into a .gzip file, balloons to a larger size of 42.2 kilobytes. This substantial difference in bundle size not only underscores Svelte's advantage but also translates to enhanced loading speed, responsiveness, and cost-efficiency. Reduced bandwidth requirements and faster page rendering become tangible benefits of choosing Svelte.

## Styling

Svelte's Developer Experience (DX) outshines React's, especially when it comes to styling. Unlike React, which offers multiple styling approaches such as StyledComponents, StyledJS, Tailwind, and more, Svelte keeps it refreshingly simple. Styling in Svelte is straightforwardâ€”developers can choose any pre-processor for their CSS. While some prefer the freedom of choice in un-opinionated frameworks, Svelte strikes a balance by providing flexibility without compromising simplicity, making it an optimal choice for developers.

## Vendor Lock-in

The evolving landscape of React, now closely tied to Next.js and optimized for Vercel, has sparked debates regarding vendor lock-in. While Next.js's affiliation with Vercel raises concerns, Svelte stands out with its adaptability. Svelte and SvelteKit, with a plethora of adaptors, can be effortlessly deployed on various hosts and infrastructures, offering developers the freedom to choose their preferred environment without the constraints associated with vendor lock-in.  Find out more about that here.  

## Conclusion

Svelte emerges as a compelling choice over React, excelling in key areas such as bundle size, styling simplicity, and freedom from vendor lock-in. As the web development landscape continues to evolve, Svelte's efficiency and flexibility position it as a strong contender for those seeking a robust and adaptable front-end framework. Ultimately, the decision between Svelte and React hinges on the specific needs and preferences of developers, but Svelte's advantages make it a worthy contender in the ever-expanding world of web development and therefore I am optimistic that in the near future I will start to see Svelte/SvelteKit on the job boards.
