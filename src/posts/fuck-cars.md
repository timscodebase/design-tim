For almost a decade now, I've been without the companionship of a carâ€”not out of some heroic or humble stance, but rather due to the aftermath of a harrowing car crash that left me grappling with financial constraints, rendering the prospect of a new vehicle beyond my reach. Thus, I find myself navigating through life by foot, relying on public transit, or graciously accepting the kindness of those willing to chauffeur me to my destinations.

It's a peculiar dance in a world that, by all accounts, should be accommodating to pedestrians. However, the reality is far from idyllic. Despite being fully able-bodied, I often find myself engaged in a delicate ballet of evading cars even within the confines of designated crosswalks. It's a testament to the increasing lack of safety for pedestrians in a world seemingly dominated by four-wheeled behemoths.

My empathy extends beyond my own experiences to those with physical handicaps who, out of necessity, share the same sidewalks that I cautiously tread. The challenges they face are amplified, and my heart goes out to them as they navigate a landscape that should be more considerate of their needs.

While it's tempting to point fingers and harbor resentment towards those behind the wheel, the true culpability extends beyond individual drivers. The cityscape itself plays a role in this precarious dance between pedestrians and vehicles. The coexistence of crossing signals and the ever-blinking green turn lights creates a chaotic intersection where blame becomes a shared burden. It's a complex web of decisions and design that leaves us all, pedestrians and drivers alike, caught in the crossfire of urban navigation.
