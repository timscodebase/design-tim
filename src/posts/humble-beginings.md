I got my start in Web development in 2005.  I had a career in IT, doing Desktop Support mostly.  I enjoyed it and love being able help people but I was looking for a change.  I had a friend who was a web developer, and he suggested I give it a try.  I had no idea what I was doing, but I was determined to learn.  I started with HTML and CSS, and I was hooked.  I loved the idea of creating something from nothing.  I was fascinated, and found the best way to learn early on was to reverse engineer sites I thought were cool and did my best to recreate them.  I had 'Firebug' and early dev tools, and my friend Eric to ask for help.  This was before Google so Alta Vista was the sad goto in those days.  Eric had been a .Net Developer and I did not care for that so I dove into JavaScript and jQuery.

My first job in my new career was an Email Marketing gig in San Francisco.  I liked it.  It was much more challenging than I suspected, but it was an excellent learning opportunity.  While I did not learn so much about JS, I did learn all about how quirky email clients are and how HTML emails are not nearly as easy to to craft as I thought.  This was also my introduction to Photoshop and image slicing.  FUN, FUN!!
