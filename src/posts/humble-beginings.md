I got my start in Web development in 2005.  I had a career in IT, doing Desktop Support mostly.  I enjoyed it and love being able help people but I was looking for a change.  I had a friend who was a web developer, and he suggested I give it a try.  I had no idea what I was doing, but I was determined to learn.  I started with HTML and CSS, and I was hooked.  I loved the idea of creating something from nothing.  I was also fascinated found the best way to learn early on was to reverse engineer site I thought were cool and did my best to recreate them.  I had 'Firebug' and early dev tools to help me and my best friend Eric to ask for help.  This was before Google so Alta Vista was the sad go to in those days.
